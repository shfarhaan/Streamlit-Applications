This is a README file for the Streamlit-Applications repository:

# Streamlit-Applications
This repository contains various applications built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive web apps. Streamlit allows you to turn your data analysis and machine learning models into beautiful and easy-to-use web apps with just a few lines of code.

## Applications
The following applications are included in this repository:

- **Iris_EDA_Web_App**: This app performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for machine learning. You can select different features, visualize the distributions and correlations, and apply different classification models to predict the species of the flowers.
- **More applications coming soon!**

## How to run
To run the applications, you need to have Streamlit installed on your system. You can install it using pip:

`pip install streamlit`

Then, you can clone this repository and navigate to the application folder. For example, to run the Iris_EDA_Web_App, you can use the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/shfarhaan/Streamlit-Applications.git`

`cd Streamlit-Applications/Iris_EDA_Web_App`

`streamlit run iris_app.py`

This will open a new tab in your browser where you can interact with the app.
